# Code & Coffee w/ People

Code and Coffee is a weekly tech focused meetup I host in Harrisonburg, VA
on [Tuesdays @ Blacksheep Coffee from 9am - 11am](http://www.blacksheepcoffeehburg.com/) in an effort to grow the local community.

This repo contains the notes for various lessons that arise in real time.
